What Travelers and Expats Miss About Renting Cars in Dubai And How To Do It Correctly  

Dubai is tailored for speed, comfort, and unfettered movement. However, tourists and new expatriates often use taxis or rideshare applications due to a perceived notion that renting a car is complicated, costly, or entails too much risk.  

We run a local car rental service and assist hundreds of travelers each month.  

Allow us to set the narrative straight.  

Uber and taxi services are more economical for short stays.  

Reality:  

They appear more economical until you:  

Travel on a daily basis (Going from JBR to Marina and then off to a Desert Safari? Quite a bit.)  

Get hit with surge pricing.  

Spend endless time waiting in long queues during peak times.  

Car rentals for two to three days make financial sense and assure fixed rates sans waiting time.  

Driving in Dubai is stressful.  

Reality:  

No doubt, one of the most challenging cities to drive in.  

Widespread roads  

Unambiguous signage (both English and Arabic)  

Friendly google map infrastructure  

No charge parking available in numerous locations, particularly at hotels and apartments.  

At Gulf Oasis, we take care of:  

All the necessary documentation
